Basketball EDA Project: How has the NBA Changed in the last 10 years?


Project Overview
This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project investigates how the NBA has evolved over the last decade, with a particular focus on the transformative impact of Steph Curry and the 2014–2015 season. Curry’s revolutionary shooting ability not only redefined what was possible on the court but also sparked a league-wide strategic shift: players across all positions began prioritizing the three-point shot, and teams increasingly embraced an analytics-driven approach to offense.
Behind this evolution lies the rise of basketball analytics, which revealed that efficiency  particularly through three-point shooting and faster pace strongly correlates with winning. These insights have since reshaped offensive strategy, team decision-making, player roles, and long-term scouting practices.
This project uses publicly available data from Basketball Reference, focusing primarily on regular-season data from 2015 to 2025. To provide historical context, select datasets extend back 10 years. Special attention is paid to outlier seasons such as those impacted by COVID-19 which may influence trends.
Organized into four thematic Jupyter Notebooks, the analysis tracks how the game has changed across multiple dimensions: the evolution of league-wide offensive strategies, shifting MVP profiles, consistency of playoff performance, and the long-term outcomes of draft class selections.

Project Structure
This project is organized into four Jupyter Notebooks, each  analyzing a different theme to help answer the central question: How has the NBA changed in the last 10 years? 
The notebooks are designed to be viewed in a specific order to guide the reader through a logical progression from broad, league-wide strategic shifts to their ripple effects on players, teams, and scouting.

    Offensive Strategy & Scoring Evolution
Focus: League-wide changes in play style, especially the rise of the 3-point shot and faster pace of play.
Why first? This notebook establishes the major structural shifts that began around 2015, notably influenced by Stephen Curry’s impact on offensive play. These changes are the foundation for all other transformations analyzed in the project.
 → Sets the stage by identifying the fundamental changes that define the modern NBA era.

    Changes in Player Profiles
Focus: How the statistical profiles and archetypes of players, particularly MVPs have evolved over time.
Why second? As the game has shifted strategically, the types of players who thrive have also changed. This notebook explores how offensive trends have shaped player roles, skills, and recognition.
 → Connect strategy to the kind of players who now thrive.
    
    Team Success & Performance Trends
Focus: Patterns in team performance and success, including correlations between defense and winning, and consistent playoff appearances.
Why third? With new offensive styles and player dynamics, we investigate how modern teams build and sustain success over time. 
→ Explores how teams have adapted and what now correlates with winning.

    Player Recognition & Draft Impact
Focus: The long-term performance and recognition of players from the same draft class, and how scouting has adjusted by role and position.
Why last? This ties together how league evolution affects long-term decisions in team building, talent evaluation, and player development — completing the narrative from game style to institutional change.
 → Wraps up by showing how team-building and talent evaluation have evolved.

Together, these notebooks create a holistic view of how the NBA has transformed over the last decade from on-court strategy to off-court decisions using 2015 as a turning point in the league’s evolution.

Analytical  Question
1. Is there a correlation between a team’s defensive rating and winning?
2. Which teams or players have the most consistent playoff appearances and success over the past decade?
3. How do players selected in the same draft class perform across their careers, and what trends emerge in scouting success by position or role?
4. How have MVP winners' stat profiles changed over time and what does this say about evolving criteria?
5. How has the 3-point shot impacted the league over time (attempts, makes, accuracy)? How has points per game changed over the last 20 seasons?


Connecting Analytical Questions to the NBA Evolution Narrative
Each of the analytical questions explored in this project ties directly into the narrative of how the NBA has transformed over the past decade, driven largely by Steph Curry’s influence and the rise of basketball analytics:
The question about the correlation between defensive rating and winning investigates how, despite the offensive revolution, defense remains a key ingredient for team success in the modern game.


Examining teams and players with consistent playoff success reveals which franchises have best adapted to evolving play styles and strategic demands.


Tracking draft class performance and scouting trends uncovers how player evaluation and recruitment have shifted to prioritize skills like three-point shooting and versatility.


Analyzing how MVP winners’ stat profiles have changed highlights the changing criteria for individual excellence, reflecting the new style that Curry helped pioneer.


Exploring the impact of the three-point shot on league scoring directly addresses the fundamental offensive shift that has redefined basketball since the 2015–2016 season.


Together, these questions provide a comprehensive framework to understand the ripple effects of one of the most significant strategic and cultural shifts in NBA history.
